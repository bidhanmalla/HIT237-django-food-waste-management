      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Annually, roughly one-third of food grown for human ingestion goes to waste globally. This translates to roughly 1.3 billion tons of food waste, costing the world economy nearly $1 trillion. Food waste has substantial environmental implications, accounting for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Many solutions exist to mitigate food waste at different points in the supply chain.
        Consumers can make an impact by planning meals ahead, creating grocery lists, adequately storing food to extend its shelf life, avoiding over-preparing meals, and composting food scraps. Restaurants and retailers can enact programs to donate unsold edible food to food banks rather than throwing it out. Farmers can prevent crop loss through enhanced harvesting and storage techniques. Governments and organizations can back these efforts through public awareness initiatives, incentives, and legislation.
        The issue of food waste is complex, but even minor reductions at each step can considerably lower the total amount of waste. With worldwide attention and action, we can make progress in confronting this serious problem. Better supply chain management, shifts in consumer behavior, food donation programs, and innovations in food production and storage all have roles to play.
        To track the issue, a food waste monitoring website could help provide data, metrics, and accountability.
